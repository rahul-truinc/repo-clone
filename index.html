                Victor grew up between Ontario and the South of France and always dreamed of bringing the best parts of the Mediterranean food culture to Canada. Aaron grew up near Toronto and was obsessed with experimenting in the kitchen to make healthier versions of his favourite snacks. They met in University and after graduating, decided to go on an adventure to the heart of the Mediterranean. After 12 days traversing the mountains of Corsica on the GR20 trail, they visited a street market in the South of France. Victor introduced Aaron to a traditional snack enjoyed in the Mediterranean for centuries: a delicious wood-fired crepe made from chickpeas and olive oil called Socca. They agreed they had to bring it to Canada and started a journey to transform this chickpea snack into a delicious chip. They spent a year experimenting with hundreds of different recipes and sold the chips at farmers markets in Toronto.

                WakeWater was born from a need for something that energized us but wasn’t a regular ol’ cup of joe or a sugary energy drink. We knew that we needed a boost to get through the day but we didn’t want the crash. So, since we couldn’t find what we were looking for, we decided to do it ourselves. We knew our team could create a beverage that was refreshing and was something we could feel good about, so we jumped in and created WakeWater. Fast forward to today and you can find WakeWater across the country as we continue to grow on our path to help Canadians energize without compromise. At WakeWater, we believe that sometimes we all need a little bit of a boost to accomplish even the little victories in life.
