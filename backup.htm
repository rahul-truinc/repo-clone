        Meet Leila, founder of Happy Pops. Through her education, Leila learned that there are many names for sugar and how it is often difficult to find products with ingredients you can recognize. As an athlete and coach, she wanted to create a unique line of ice pops suitable for breakfast on the go, post-workout, or for a refreshing afternoon snack. Drawing on her South Asian heritage, she has developed a unique flavour offering of handcrafted ice pops free of artifical ingredients.

        After adopting a plant-based diet, Liz Long quickly realized the limitations in peanut/nut-free options. Liz and her husband made it their mission to create a line of products that were allergy-free and made with wholesome ingredients. Drawing upon knowledge from the dairy industry, they began crafting vegan cheese from sunflower seeds, ticking every box, including low allergic reactions and great taste—approved by the toughest critics, their children. Liz's goal is to continue innovating the category while offering nutritious products they are proud to serve.
